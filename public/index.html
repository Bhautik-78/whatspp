        Whatsapp is one of the most admired andextensively used messaging

        it is impractical to visualize a life without WhatsApp. It has
        become a part of our life, anideal mode to bond with your family,

        whichallows individual to send Whatsapp message without adding
        contact number.
        The annoying part of WhatsApp:Though it comes with a myriad of
        facilities and isupdating regularly one thing that annoys users
        is that youcan only share your content with those who are on
        yourcontact list. There is no other way to share information with
        thosewho are not on
        your contact list.This is a very significant feature that keeps your
        privacyrestricted and does not allow anyone to get access toyour
        status and DP
        but it also creates ruckus as youcannot save everyone’s contact and
        burden your phonewith a long list of users.
